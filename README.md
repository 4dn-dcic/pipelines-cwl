# pipelines-cwl
* This is a collection of pipelines built by 4DN-DCIC that were used to process 4DN data on the 4DN portal using Tibanna workflow executor.

### Directories
* `cwl_awsem_v1` : Tibanna AWSEM CWLs in v1.0 in json format

### How to run the cwl
To run docker through CWL, you need a cwl executor - we use `cwltool` (https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) to run CWL with a json/yml file describing input data. Some example input data are inside the `tests/test_input_json` directory and you can see some `cwltool` (=`cwl-runner`) commands inside the `tests/tests.sh` script.


### Testing CWL
To test cwls in this repo against the test files in `tests`, use `tests/tests_v1.sh` with cwl name (without .cwl).
```bash
source tests/tests_v1.sh bwa-mem
```

### Notes on releases

#### Freeze 0.2.7

* All CWL is now in the folder `cwl`.

The 4DN pipeline suite freeze `0.2.7` is equivalent to the following.
* Hi-C processing pipeline `v43`
* Repliseq processing pipeline `v16`
* FastQC `v2`


#### Freeze >= 0.2.6
* All CWL is converted to version 1 (no more draft3) and they are kept in the folder `cwl_awsem_v1`.

#### Freeze >=0.0.2
* Directory `cwl_awsem` is manually updated starting from freeze 0.0.2 (after Sep 1, 2017), since we no longer use SevenBridges.

#### Freeze `0.0.1` 
* Freeze `0.0.1` contains exported SBG CWLs and AWSEM CWL files auto-converted from SBG CWLs. The following is a description of how freeze 0.0.1 was generated.

    The content has been generated by the following command.
    ```
    source download.sh 
    ```
    For this to work, you need to have SBG_TOKEN as an environmental variable on your machine.



    To convert sbg cwl to awsem cwl in a batch, do the following
    ```
    source convert.sh
    ```
    This conversion uses script `convert_sbgcwl_to_awsemcwl.py` individually.
    The shell script assumes Mac (`xargs -I{}` instead of `xargs -i`).
